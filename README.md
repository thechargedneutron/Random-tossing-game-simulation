# Random-tossing-game-simulation

The function `show_distribution` simulates the tossing game as explained:


The game starts with a certian number of players having 1 rupee each. They randomly meet any other person and toss a coin. The winner gets the coin the looser had. 

Download it and open MATLAB and change your directory to the path of this file. Enter `show_distribution(number_of_persons,number_of_iterations)` and there you get the plot of the simulation.
